1. Check infiles
	- if infile
		- open and dup
		- if old_fd
			- clear old_fd[0]
	- if no infile
		- if old_fd
			- stdin = old_fd[0]
			- close(old_fd[0])
		-else
			- do nothing
2. Check outfile
	- if not last
		- pipe
	- if outfile
		- open and dup
	- if no outfile
		- if not last
			- stdout = fd[1]
			- close(fd[1])
		- else
			- do nothing to stdout
3. Search command
	- if builtin
		- if no pipe && (unset || export)
			- exec unset/export in parent
	- if absolute path
		- exec
	- search in PATH
4. Fork
	- Exec command
	- If fails
		- clear old_fd[0]
5. If pipe after
	- recursion (old_fd, ...)


Cases :
	- conditiom =
		- status = exec
	- success and next is &&
		- status = exec
	- success and next is ||
		- status is not changed
	- fail and next is &&
		- status is not changed
	- fail and next is ||
		- stauts = exec
