1. Check infiles
	- if infile
		- open and dup
		- if old_fd
			- clear old_fd[0]
	- if no infile
		- if old_fd
			- stdin = old_fd[0]
			- close(old_fd[0])
		-else
			- do nothing
2. Check outfile
	- if not last
		- pipe
	- if outfile
		- open and dup
	- if no outfile
		- if not last
			- stdout = fd[1]
			- close(fd[1])
		- else
			- do nothing to stdout
3. Search command
	- If not absolute path && not builtin
		- Search in path
4. if found || bultin
	- Fork
	- If builtin
		- Clear old_fd
		- Exec bultin
	- Else
		- Execve
	- Clear old_fd
5. If pipe after
	- recursion (old_fd, ...)


Cases :
	- conditiom =
		- status = exec
	- success and next is &&
		- status = exec
	- success and next is ||
		- status is not changed
	- fail and next is &&
		- status is not changed
	- fail and next is ||
		- stauts = exec
